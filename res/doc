# NickelMenu (libnm.so)
#
# This tool injects menu items into Nickel.
#
# It should work on firmware 4.6+, but it has only been tested on 4.20.14622. It
# is perfectly safe to try out on any newer firmware version, as it has a lot of
# error checking, and a failsafe mechanism which automatically uninstalls it as
# a last resort.
#
# Place your configuration files in this folder (/mnt/onboard/.adds/nm). They
# can be named anything, and should consist of multiple lines either starting
# with # for a comment, or in one of the the following formats (spaces around
# fields are ignored):
#
#   menu_item:<location>:<label>:<action>:<arg>
#     Adds a menu item.
#
#     <location>  the menu to add the item to, one of:
#                   main   - the menu in the top-left corner of the home screen
#                   reader - the overflow menu in the reader
#     <label>     the label to show on the menu item (must not contain :)
#     <action>    the type of action to run, one of:
#                   cmd_spawn      - starts another process or script in the background
#                   cmd_output     - runs a command and displays the output
#                   dbg_syslog     - writes a message to syslog (for testing)
#                   dbg_error      - always returns an error (for testing)
#                   dbg_msg        - shows a message (for testing)
#                   dbg_toast      - shows a toast (for testing)
#                   kfmon          - triggers a kfmon action
#                   nickel_setting - toggles a boolean setting
#                   nickel_extras  - opens one of the beta features
#                   nickel_misc    - other stuff which isn't significant enough for its own category
#                   nickel_open    - opens a view
#                   power          - gracefully controls the power state
#                   skip           - skips a number of actions after the current one (mainly useful for more complex conditional chains) (this action will not update the success/failure flag)
#     <arg>       the argument passed to the action:
#                   cmd_spawn      - the command line to pass to /bin/sh -c (started in /)
#                                    It can be prefixed with "quiet:" to prevent the toast with the process PID from being displayed.
#                   cmd_output     - the timeout in milliseconds (0 < t < 10000), a colon, then the command line to pass to /bin/sh -c (started in /)
#                                    It can be prefixed with "quiet:" to prevent the message box with the output from being displayed (i.e. you'd use this where you'd normally use >/dev/null 2>&1).
#                   dbg_syslog     - the text to write
#                   dbg_error      - the error message
#                   dbg_msg        - the message
#                   dbg_toast      - the message
#                   kfmon          - the filename of the KFMon watched item to launch.
#                                    This is actually the basename of the watch's filename as specified in its KFMon config (i.e., the png).
#                                    You can also check the output of the 'list' command via the kfmon-ipc tool.
#                   nickel_setting - one of:
#                                      invert      - toggles FeatureSettings.InvertScreen

#                                      force_wifi  - toggles DeveloperSettings.ForceWifiOn (note: the setting doesn't apply until you toggle WiFi)
#                   nickel_extras  - the mimetype of the plugin, or one of:

#                   power          - one of:

#
#   chain_success:<action>:<arg>
#   chain_failure:<action>:<arg>
#   chain_always:<action>:<arg>
#     Adds an action to the chain that began with the preceding menu_item.
#     Actions are performed in the order they are written.
#     Each chain entry MUST follow the menu_item it is attached to. Another
#     menu_item marks the start of the next chain.
#     By default, each action only executes if the previous one was successful.
#     If chain_failure is used, the action is only executed if the last one
#     failed. If chain_always is used, the action is executed no matter what.
#     Any error message is only displayed if the action is the last one which
#     was executed in the chain (not necessarily the last one in the config
#     file).
#
#   generator:<location>:<generator>
#   generator:<location>:<generator>:<arg>
#     Generates menu items dynamically during startup.
#
#     <location>   the menu to add the items to, same as for menu_item.
#     <generator>  the generator to use to generate the options, one of:
#                    _test - generates numbered items, for testing only
#                    kfmon - adds items from kfmon
#     <arg>        the argument passed to the generator (if needed):
#                    _test - the number of items to generate (0-10)
#                    kfmon - one or none of:
#                              gui - only enumerate non-hidden active KFMon watches (this is the default)
#                              all - enumerate *every* active KFMon watches
#
# For example, you might have a configuration file in KOBOeReader/.adds/nm/mystuff like:
#

#
# You will need to reboot to see any changes.
#
# If there is an error in the configuration, an item which displays it will be
# added to the main menu. If an internal error occurs, it is written to syslog,
# which can be viewed over telnet or SSH (the username is root) with the command
# logread.
#
# To uninstall NickelMenu, create a file named KOBOeReader/.adds/nm/uninstall,
# or manually uninstall it by deleting libnm.so. You can also uninstall it by
# triggering the failsafe mechanism by turning your Kobo off within 20 seconds
# of turning it on.
