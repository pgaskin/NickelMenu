# NickelMenu (libnm.so)
# https://pgaskin.net/NickelMenu
#
# This tool injects menu items into Nickel.
#
# It should work on firmware 4.6+, but it has only been tested on 4.20.14622 -
# 4.31.19086. It is perfectly safe to try out on any newer firmware version, as
# it has a lot of error checking, and a failsafe mechanism which automatically
# uninstalls it as a last resort.
#
# Place your configuration files in this folder. They can be named anything, and
# should consist of multiple lines either starting with # for a comment, or in
# one of the the following formats (spaces around fields are ignored):
#
#   menu_item:<location>:<label>:<action>:<arg>
#     Adds a menu item.
#
#     <location>  the menu to add the item to, one of:
#                   main             - the menu in the top-left corner of the home screen
#                                      (in firmware 4.23.15505+, this menu was removed, so a new item will be added to the tabs on the bottom-right)
#                   reader           - the overflow menu in the reader
#                   browser          - the menu in the bottom-right of the web browser
#                   library          - the menu in the filter bar for the "My Books" and "My Articles" library views
#                   selection        - the selection menu (4.20.14622+)
#                                      all arguments will support substitutions in the form {A|B|C} as follows (see the end of this file for examples):
#                                          A is the string to substitute
#                                              1 - current selection
#                                          B is zero or more transformations applied from left to right:
#                                              a - all to lowercase
#                                              A - all to uppercase
#                                              f - keep everything up to the first whitespace character
#                                              n - remove non-alphanumeric
#                                              s - trim whitespace
#                                              S - normalize whitespace (trim, then collapse multiple whitespace chars)
#                                              u - replace whitespace with underscores
#                                              w - remove all whitespace
#                                              x - special: return an error if the string is empty at this point
#                                          C is zero or more escape methods applied from left to right:
#                                              " - escape for double-quoted strings (JSON-compatible, C-compatible):
#                                                  "               => \"
#                                                  newline         => \n
#                                                  backspace       => \b
#                                                  tab             => \t
#                                                  form-feed       => \f
#                                                  carriage-return => \r
#                                                  \               => \\
#                                              $ - escape for single-quoted strings (bash-compatible):

#                                              % - url encode all non-alphanumeric chars
#                   selection_search - the search sub-menu of the selection menu (4.20.14622+)
#                                      see above
#     <label>     the label to show on the menu item (must not contain :)
#     <action>    the type of action to run, one of:
#                   cmd_spawn          - starts a command in the background
#                   cmd_output         - runs a command, waits for it to exit, and optionally displays the output
#                   dbg_syslog         - writes a message to syslog (for testing)
#                   dbg_error          - always returns an error (for testing)

#                                        (on firmware 4.23.15505+, you won't be able to exit the browser unless you use the "modal" option or add "menu_item:browser:Quit:nickel_misc:home" to the config)
#                   nickel_misc        - other stuff which isn't significant enough for its own category
#                   nickel_open        - opens a view
#                   nickel_wifi        - controls wifi (note: it doesn't wait for it to connect or disconnect, neither does it check for success)
#                   nickel_bluetooth   - controls bluetooth
#                   nickel_orientation - controls screen orientation
#                                        (devices without an orientation sensor may need to use the kobopatch patch "Allow rotation on all devices" or set [DeveloperSettings] ForceAllowLandscape=true)
#                                        (devices with an orientation sensor don't need to do anything, but can set the config setting to make this work on all views)
#                                        (this will override the rotation icon/popup until it is set to something different or the device is rebooted)
#                   power              - gracefully controls the power state
#                   skip               - skips a number of actions after the current one (mainly useful for more complex conditional chains) (this action will not update the success/failure flag)
#     <arg>       the argument passed to the action:
#                   cmd_spawn          - the command line to pass to /bin/sh -c (started in /)
#                                        It can be prefixed with "quiet:" to prevent the toast with the process PID from being displayed.
#                   cmd_output         - the timeout in milliseconds (0 < t < 10000), a colon, then the command line to pass to /bin/sh -c (started in /)
#                                        It can be prefixed with "quiet:" to prevent the message box with the output from being displayed (i.e. you'd use this where you'd normally use >/dev/null 2>&1).
#                   dbg_syslog         - the text to write
#                   dbg_error          - the error message
#                   dbg_msg            - the message
#                   dbg_toast          - the message
#                   kfmon              - the filename of the KFMon watched item to launch.
#                                        This is actually the basename of the watch's filename as specified in its KFMon config (i.e., the png).
#                                        You can also check the output of the 'list' command via the kfmon-ipc tool.
#                   nickel_setting     - <action>:<setting>
#                                        action is one of:

#   chain_success:<action>:<arg>
#   chain_failure:<action>:<arg>
#   chain_always:<action>:<arg>
#     Adds an action to the chain that began with the preceding menu_item.
#     Actions are performed in the order they are written.
#     Each chain entry MUST follow the menu_item it is attached to. Another
#     menu_item marks the start of the next chain.
#     By default, each action only executes if the previous one was successful.
#     If chain_failure is used, the action is only executed if the last one
#     failed. If chain_always is used, the action is executed no matter what.
#     Any error message is only displayed if the action is the last one which
#     was executed in the chain (not necessarily the last one in the config
#     file).
#
#   generator:<location>:<generator>
#   generator:<location>:<generator>:<arg>
#     Generates menu items dynamically during startup.
#
#     <location>   the menu to add the items to, same as for menu_item.
#     <generator>  the generator to use to generate the options, one of:
#                    _test - generates numbered items, for testing only
#                    kfmon - adds items from kfmon
#     <arg>        the argument passed to the generator (if needed):
#                    _test - the number of items to generate (0-10)
#                    kfmon - one or none of:
#                              gui - only enumerate non-hidden active KFMon watches (this is the default)
#                              all - enumerate all active KFMon watches
#
#   experimental:<key>:<val>
#     Sets an experimental option. These are not guaranteed to be stable or be
#     compatible across NickelMenu or firmware versions, and may stop working at
#     any time. In addition, these options may not take effect without a reboot.
#     Unknown options are ignored. If there are multiple declarations of an
#     option, only the first one takes effect.
#
#     <key>  the option name:
#              menu_main_15505_<main menu option>      - controls the added NickelMenu button
#              menu_main_15505_<n>_<main_menu_option>  - controls the main menu button at position n (indexed from 0)
#                                                        note that there may be already-hidden buttons in the list:
#                                                        on a Kobo Libra Colour running 4.41.23145, the button list is:
#                                                            0 - Home
#                                                            1 - My Books
#                                                            2 - Activity [hidden by default]
#                                                            3 - My Notebooks
#                                                            4 - Discover
#                                                            5 - More
#
#              <main menu option>    one of:
#                  enabled          - controls enablement of the NickelMenu button on 4.23.15505+
#                  label            - sets the label used for the NickelMenu button on 4.23.15505+
#                  icon             - sets the icon used for the NickelMenu button on 4.23.15505+
#                  icon_active      - sets the active icon used for the NickelMenu button on 4.23.15505+
#
#     <val>  the option value:
#              (..)_enabled     -> 0 or 1
#              (..)_label       -> the label to use instead of the default value
#              (..)_icon        -> the path passed to QPixmap
#              (..)_icon_active -> the path passed to QPixmap

# If there is an error in the configuration, an item which displays it will be
# added to the main menu. If an internal error occurs, it is written to syslog,
# which can be viewed over telnet or SSH (the username is root) with the command
# logread.
#
# To uninstall NickelMenu, create a file in this directory named "uninstall",
# or manually uninstall it by deleting libnm.so. You can also uninstall it by
# triggering the failsafe mechanism by turning your Kobo off within 20 seconds
# of turning it on.
#
# To use NickelMenu to launch other software, you can usually use cmd_spawn with
# the normal launch script. For example, KOReader and Plato will work as-is (or
# with NiLuJe's one-click install packages which include NM). For specific
# instructions, you should see their documentation (most newer software has
# information about NickelMenu). If using cmd_spawn directly doesn't work, you
# can also try using KFMon and the kfmon action/generator.
